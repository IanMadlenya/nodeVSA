# nodeVSA

None of my stock trading software does exactly what I want it to, so I figured I'd just build a tool.

Retrieves stock data for a list of your tickers, cleans it, and (eventually) scans for supply and demand tests, which are a pretty decent trading signal.

## How to:

Visit [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) and get an API key.

Add key to `nodeVSA.js.`

Run `git clone https://github.com/wnmurphy/nodeVSA.git`

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `node nodeVSA`.
